## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify news articles as either fake or real. This is achieved by training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of news articles. The classifier preprocesses the text, extracts features using TF-IDF, and then applies the model to predict the labels.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are `kaggle_fake_train.csv` and `kaggle_fake_test.csv`.

### Training Data (`kaggle_fake_train.csv`)
- `id`: Unique identifier for each news article.
- `title`: Title of the news article.
- `author`: Author of the news article.
- `text`: Full text of the news article.
- `label`: Binary label where `1` indicates fake news and `0` indicates real news.

### Testing Data (`kaggle_fake_test.csv`)
- `id`: Unique identifier for each news article.
- `title`: Title of the news article.
- `author`: Author of the news article.
- `text`: Full text of the news article.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `google-colab` (if using Google Colab)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas numpy scikit-learn
